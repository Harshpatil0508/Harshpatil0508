Hi, I’m Harshvardhan.

I build backend systems that are meant to run in production, not just pass demos.

Most of my work revolves around:
- Python & Django
- Distributed background jobs (Celery, Airflow)
- Databases, caching, and performance
- Healthcare systems and workflow automation
- Practical GenAI (RAG, document processing, automation)

I care about:
- Clear data models
- Predictable APIs
- Systems that fail gracefully
- Choosing boring tech and using it well

Recent work:
- Prior Authorization automation for US healthcare
- GenAI-based letter generation and document Q&A
- Multi-tenant backend systems with role-based access
- ETL pipelines and scheduled workflows

Tech I regularly use:
Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, Airflow, React, Docker, AWS

You’ll mostly find backend-heavy projects here.
If something looks simple, that’s usually intentional.
